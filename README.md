# Overview

I have created this financial Firebase app to save in database information using CRUD to further my learning and enhance my skills in this NoSQL Database along with Python language. This project allows users to register, login, update log out and delete the user, track their income and expenses. It provides functionality to add income and expense amounts, calculate total average income and average expense, show financial information as well as user information in database.

# Development Environment

The software was developed using the following tools:

- Python: A OOP Language
- Libraries: firebase_admin, tabulate, colorama, pyfiglet
- Visual Studio Code: IDE or text editor 
- Firebase Firestore: a NoSQL serverless database with real-time notification capability, and together with the Firebase ecosystem it greatly simplifies common app development challenges while letting the application developer focus primarily on their business logic and user experience.

# Useful Websites

During the development of this project, the following websites were helpful:

- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs?hl=es-419)
- [Stackoverflow](Stackoverflow.com)
- [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- [BYUI resources](https://byui-cse.github.io/cse310-course/modules/module_descriptions.html)

# Description

The module3.py script is a Python program that demonstrates basic functionality for a financial management application. It allows users to register, authenticate, and update their profile, as well as insert income and expenses and view their financial information. The program uses Firebase Firestore as the database to store user data and financial records.

The financial.json file contains the credentials necessary to connect to the Firebase Firestore database. That is why I keep secure and not shared publicly.
